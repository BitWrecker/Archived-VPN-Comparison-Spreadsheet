# Archived-VPN-Comparison-Spreadsheet
The other day I went looking for the VPN spreadsheet created by ThatPrivacyGuy. 
Sadly, I discovered that it had been taken down many years ago. 
After some extensive, digging I managed to find an archived version in the Wayback Machine, however it is a version from March 20, 2016.
While, I do not think that all of the information is 100% up-to-date I think a great deal of the information is still relevant. 
This document represents hundreds of hours of research and testing and should be saved forever. 
Moving forward, I would love to see new information added (or old information updated) by the community. 
All are welcome to contribute.


# Included Files
1. Archived VPN Comparison Spreadsheet from ThatPrivacyGuy - Horizontal Comment View.csv
  - Contains the CSV view of the spreadsheet so that it can be viewed in GitHub through the browser.
  - Note: Comments are pushed to the end of the data table so new entries can be added without the need to insert rows.
2. Archived VPN Comparison Spreadsheet from ThatPrivacyGuy - Horizontal Comment View.xlsx
  - This is the original Spreadsheet that I worked to archive. It is formatted and looks pretty. 
  - Comments are placed on the side following the data table. This way new entries can more easily be added without needed to insert rows (as mentioned above).
3. Archived VPN Comparison Spreadsheet - March 20 2016 - Raw.xlsx
  - This is the Spreadsheet in a raw format without the CommentExtractor.vba script run on it to consolidate the comments in cells. It's the prettiest format from a viewer's perspective. 
4. CommentExtractor.vba
  - This is the VBA script that was used to extract all of the comments/notes from the original spreadsheet and put them in their own cells.
  - It lists the cell's location in the first column and the commented text in the second.
  - Can be used to extract new comments if they are added to future version of the data sheet. The comments are only needed to be extracted so they can be placed in a CSV file without having to overcrowd each entry. This is just a visual thing so it can be easily viewed in GitHub.
